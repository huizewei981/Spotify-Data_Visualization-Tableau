# Spotify-Dataset


## Project Overview:

In this project, we'll be looking into potential factors that may affect the popularity of songs, and finding the music trends throughout the years based on the Spotify dataset. The music industry changes rapidly due to the fast-forwarding lifestyle of people's lives. We have a large pool of songs that can be listened to throughout multiple resources, online or offline. The way that we appreciate music changes since we not only listening to songs but trying to understand them. Tableau Dashboard will be the primary tool for this project to visualize the changes and to present insights.

## Data Source:
There are more than 170,000 songs have been collected in this dataset, including 78 variables and released years between 1921 and 2020. Each song has it's unique id generated by spotify. Original dataset downloaded from Kaggle. 

#### Numerical:
acousticness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
danceability (Ranges from 0 to 1)
energy (Ranges from 0 to 1)
duration_ms (Integer typically ranging from 200k to 300k)
instrumentalness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
valence (Ranges from 0 to 1)
popularity (Ranges from 0 to 100)
tempo (Float typically ranging from 50 to 150)
liveness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
loudness (Float typically ranging from -60 to 0)
speechiness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
year (Ranges from 1921 to 2020)
#### Dummy:
mode (0 = Minor, 1 = Major)
explicit (0 = No explicit content, 1 = Explicit content)
#### Categorical:
key (All keys on octave encoded as values ranging from 0 to 11, starting on C as 0, C# as 1 and so onâ€¦)
artists (List of artists mentioned)
release_date (Date of release mostly in yyyy-mm-dd format, however precision of date may vary)
name (Name of the song)

## Dashboard & Summary 

### Dashboard -1 

<a href="https://ibb.co/N2Lvd4C"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/r2ZjRW0/Screen-Shot-2020-12-30-at-11-40-46-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-12-30-at-11-40-46-PM" border="0"></a>

We can find interesting insights from this dashboard:
1. The "Number of Songs Published" shows the distribution of songs been published from each year. The number of published songs was not stable until around 1950, and in 2018 it reached the historical highest point which is 2,103 number of songs published. (Fun Fact: Rock & Roll dominated popular music in the mid 1950s and late 1950s.)
2. The top artist who published the most number of songs is "Francisco Canaro" and the artists with highest average popular score are "Bad Bunny" and "Jhay Cortez".
3. The hottest song is "Dakiti".
4. Throughout the time, the duration of songs dropped with respect to increase in popularity. People are more likely to listen shorter length of songs. 
5. The acousticness of songs drastically decrease since 1960, meaning that tracks have become less "Acoustic" but with higher popularity.


### Comparison:

A closer look at the comparison between different features changed overtime, the avgerage "Acoutsticness" dropped significantly compare to others whereas the "Liveness" kept simliar throughout years. "Energy" increased overtime with a relatively stable speed. 


### Correlation Matrix with respect to various features:

From the correlation matrix, it appears that "Danceability" and "Valence" may have some positive relationship, as well as "speechiness" and "Danceability".

### Now, let's take a look at Genres.
### Dashboard -2
Overall genres rankings for each feature:

These rankings will navigate you to genres that you might be interested in with it's unique features. An example would be if I were to find top genres that has highest danceability, then the "Experimental House" may potentially be the type of music that I'm looking for.


## Thoughts:
The dataset tells a fairly straightforward story with regards to the music industry since 1921. From the Tableau visualizations, we can found the changes between different features of songs and how they may affect people's opinions. A collection of rankings for genres provides a straightforward recommendation for people who are specifically looking for any type of music. However, there are still some limitations given that the dataset didn't include any geographical information of songs and artists, or even customers who rated those songs, which may lead to ambiguous predictions on the popularity ratings.
